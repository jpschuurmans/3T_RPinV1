This folder contains the experiment to test.
One run has a duration of ~= 8.5min

For everything to work properly:
- don't change or move any files/folders
- use the same name for 1 participant for different runs (otherwise the data will save in a different folder)
- to end (break the loop) press Ctrl+C -> your data will be saved anyway 
- you can also press "esc" in stead of a "normal" trial response

- make sure stimuli are in "/stimuli" and noise frames in "/noiseFrames" (git will ignore)


Causion: Extremely boring :D
